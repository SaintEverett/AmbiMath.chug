<h1>Spherical Harmonics in ChucK</h1>
<p>This ChucK chugin is designed as a class library that provides simple methods of calculating cartesian coordinate systems using spherical harmonics. You can easily call coordinates from this library in up to 12th order spherical harmonics. Simply use functions such as ".x(direction angle, elevation angle)" to call your x coordinate. All coordinate functions receive the arguments, directional angle and elevation angle. The W coordinate value is 1 according to SN3D standards. You can also call the .all function that, given direction, elevation, and order, will calculate your complete SH set according to the order provided and return as a float[].</p>
